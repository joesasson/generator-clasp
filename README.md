> Generate a clasp project with a bunch of useful files for a google sheets addon

## Installation

First, install [Yeoman](http://yeoman.io) and generator-clasp using [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (we assume you have pre-installed [node.js](https://nodejs.org/)).

```bash
npm install -g yo
npm install -g generator-clasp
```

Then generate your new project:

```bash
yo clasp
```

To finish setting up your clasp project:

- Ensure that you are logged in to [clasp](https://github.com/google/clasp) 
- run `clasp create` to start the clasp cli
- run `npm i -S @types/google-apps-script` to add type definitions for vscode autocomplete
- Revel in the awesomeness of life :sunglasses:

## Files generated

- `.claspignore`
- `.gitignore` with a few entries
- README.md and LICENSE
- `jsconfig.json` and `tsconfig.json` for vscode
- `keys.ts` to store keys locally (I'm still trying to figure out a better way to do this as there is no .env for gas)
- A main `Code.ts` file with the name of the app autogenerated via prompt - Also contains biolerplate for `onOpen` and getting a spreadsheet, sheet and data
- `utils.ts` file to hold some useful functions that I normally use (This is the major motivation for this generator)


## Getting To Know Yeoman

 * Yeoman has a heart of gold.
 * Yeoman is a person with feelings and opinions, but is very easy to work with.
 * Yeoman can be too opinionated at times but is easily convinced not to be.
 * Feel free to [learn more about Yeoman](http://yeoman.io/).
